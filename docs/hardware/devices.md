# devices

jaide supports a few devices:

[disk](devices/disk.md): hard disk
[graphics + keyboard](devices/graphics.md): graphics output and keyboard input
[pit](devices/pit.md): programmable interval timer
[rtc](devices/rtc.md): real-time clock

## memory-mapped i/o

device registers live in the 256-word region from `0xFE00` to `0xFEFF`. access them with `GET` and `PUT`.

device mmio is word-addressed and bank-independent. reads and writes are dispatched by the emulator's memory bus.

see the table below for a listing of each device's registers.

| offset | device    | access | meaning                                             |
| ------ | --------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `0x01` | keyboard  | R      | read pending key code and clear ready state         |
| `0x02` | keyboard  | R      | `1` when a key is ready, otherwise `0`              |
| `0x10` | pit       | R/W    | reload value                                        |
| `0x11` | pit       | R/W    | bit 0: enabled/disabled, bit 1: one-shot/continuous |
| `0x20` | disk      | W      | command: `0` read, `1` write                        |
| `0x21` | disk      | W      | sector number                                       |
| `0x22` | disk      | W      | dma memory address                                  |
| `0x23` | disk      | R      | status: `0` idle, `1` busy, `2` error               |
| `0x30` | rtc       | R      | second                                              |
| `0x31` | rtc       | R      | minute                                              |
| `0x32` | rtc       | R      | hour                                                |
| `0x33` | rtc       | R      | day of year                                         |
| `0x40` | display   | R/W    | bit 0 enables output                                |
| `0xFF` | system    | W      | system interface, see below                         |

unknown mmio reads return zero with a warning, and unknown writes have no defined result.
the emulator scans devices in registration order and is destructive when assigning addresses.

## system interface

mmio address `0xFEFF` controls the physical hardware.

| value  | command      | emulator behavior          | hardware behavior  |
| ------ | ------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `0x00` | nop          | do nothing                 | do nothing         |
| `0x01` | reset        | clear ram/regs, set pc = 0 | pull reset pin low |
| `0x02` | halt         | set halted = true          | stop the clock     |
| `0x03` | shutdown     | shut down emulator process | disconnect power   |
| other  | _undefined_  | _undefined_                | _undefined_        |
